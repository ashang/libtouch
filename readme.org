** Target
Represents an area or region on the screen.
** Action
Represents one action, one part of a gesture.
The possible actions are
- Touch
- Move
- Rotate
- Pinch
- Delay
Each action can have
*** Treshold
Decides how much/how many/etc the action must be performed. E.g. the number of fingers for a touch, or the lenght of a movement.
*** Target
Where the action must take place. A movement is considered complete when it reaches the target.
*** Duration
Maximum duration within which an action must take place.
*** Move Tolerance
How much is minimum movement, before it is regarded as actual movement. E.g. a tap and hold may move X pixels without being regarded as a swipe.
** Gesture
A gesture is a series of actions, each must be completed before the next begins.
** Engine
The `libtouch_engine` is responsible for controlling the internal state. i.e. deciding which gestures are progressing, and how much.

The inner state is updated through the functions

#+BEGIN_SRC C
libtouch_engine_register_move
libtouch_engine_register_touch
#+END_SRC
